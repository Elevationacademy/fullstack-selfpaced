# Nodemon

> since node 18, instead of using an external library you can simply use `node --watch server.js` for running the server automatically after every file save. Still, nodemon has more features (e.g. excluding files from auto refresh) so the steps are still here below.

So far when we made changes in our code, we had to save the file, kill the server pressing `ctrl + c` and then run again `node server.js`.

It's annoying!

Luckily for us there is a package that will run the server automatically every time the files where saved.

Open your terminal and run the command `npm install -g nodemon`

The ``-g`` is a flag the tells the computer to install the package globally (it's mean that you can run the command in any project without installing the package again and again).

Now, instead of running `node server.js` you should run `nodemon server.js`.

try changing something in the server.js and save it, go to the browser and refresh the page, you should see the new updates!!
