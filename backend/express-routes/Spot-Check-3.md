# Spot Check 3

Create a route called ``/details` that extracts the optional parameters `zipcode`, `city`, and `middleName`. Once you get the details, console log the `city` in the server, then send a response with all the params.

  

Ultimately, when you go to your route, you should receive an object that looks like this:

  
```js
{
  zipcode: "6863155",
  city: "Ankh Morpork",
  middleName: "Wilfred"
}
```
  

The route should look like [this](https://codepen.io/ElevationPen/pen/qzmarZ?editors=0010).
