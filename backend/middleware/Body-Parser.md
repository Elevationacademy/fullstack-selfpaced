# Body Parser

When we make a POST request from the browser, behind the scenes **the browser is turning the data we're sending into a JSON** - this is a good thing because it allows us to forgo the `JSON.stringify` bit.

  

However, since we are sending JSON, the server needs to know that it needs to **parse** that JSON.

To do that, we need to add the following to our `server.js`:

```js
app.use(express.json())
```
  

* You can add the above code under all the `require`s but above the other lines of `app.use`.

  

We'll dive into what `use` is later in this lesson, but for now it's enough to understand that this code allows our server to receive and parse JSON.

Now if you restart your server, refresh your page, type in a Wonder and Location, and press the `Add Wonder` button:

Excellent! We've sent some data to our server through a POST request - note that this is **different** than sending data through GET parameters!

  

When we send data through GET, we're doing it through the **route**, i.e. the URL - this is not always safe or what we want. Plus, it is not convenient when we want to send lots of data - especially if it's more complex data.

  

Sending data with a **POST request allows us to send any JS object**. This is great.

  

And now, of course, we want to _add_ this object to our `wonders` array in the server.
