# Installations and Signups

Hi there! üëã 

We are excited to see you here! ü§© Getting all ready for this unique oppurtunity and path of being a full-stack developer ü§ìüßë‚Äçüíª

Please go ahead and make sure that the following is installed on your laptop.

## Visual Studio Code
This is the IDE we will be using during the bootcamp. It is the most popular IDE in the world.

Download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Git
Just like everyone, also we will be using git for version control. Download and install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

To make sure git is installed correctly, let‚Äôs type the following in your terminal (relaunch the terminal after installing):
```bash
git --version
```
you should see the git version.

It is very important to validate the actions that we do, especially when we
learn something new.

Take that as a tip :)

Now we are going to configure Git. If you have never used git before, you
need to do some setup first.

It is a one time thing, so let‚Äôs do it. If you have git already setup, you can
skip this part.

Run the following commands so that git knows your username and email (use the same email as for your GitHub account - see next).

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## GitHub
GitHub for git is like Google Drive for your files. This is the place in the cloud we (and prettly much the entire humanity) stores its code (git repositories). Make sure you have an account in [GitHub](https://github.com/).

When creating the account please note the following:
1. Use your main email address you regulary check
1. Use the same email address as you used to configure git in the previuos step
1. make sure to choose a github username that includes you real name. For example, if your name is Dan Abramov (who is he you must wonder, go ahead and check) choose one of the following:
    - danabramov
    - AbramovDan
    - danabra
    - danabramov87

#### Personal Access Tokens
Personal access tokens are an alternative to using passwords for authentication to GitHub when using the GitHub API or the command line.

Create a Personal Access Token (classic). See instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic). 


## Node JS

Node JS (a.k.a Node.js, node.js, node js) is a **JavaScript runtime environment** - this just means that it‚Äôs somewhere we can run JS code that‚Äôs not the browser. We‚Äôll just call it Node* for simplicity.

Go ahead and install node from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

Validate your installation by running the following command from your terminal:
```bash
node -v
```

## Postman
[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a software development tool. It enables people to test calls to APIs. You‚Äôll find out more all about that during the course. For now you just need to download this software. 

So go ahead and [download Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/), then install it on your computer.
