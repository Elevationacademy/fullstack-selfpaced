# Switch Sides - Merge Conflicts

Now let's try this again, this time partner B and Partner A switch roles.

Partner B, you **open up a new repo on your github** this time, and add partner A as a collaborator.

  

But, **Partner A**, when it comes to your turn, you're also going to fill in some boilerplate on the `server.js` because you're impatient.

  

Follow along with the instructions like you did before, **but partner A do not run** **`git pull origin master`** **before you open your pull request this time.**

  

**Partner A**, when you get to your pull request, you'll notice that github says it _cannot automatically merge the changes_ this time. Like the message says, don't worry. You can still open the pull request. **So go ahead and make the pull request**

This time you cannot merge your conflicts right away. **So partner A, you need to click resolve conflicts** to go and resolve your conflicts.

The next screen you'll see is githubs conflict resolving screen. Whether you resolve conflicts on github or in your code editor, most of it looks the same:

For each conflict, you have:

-   The `<<<<<<< your-branch`, followed by the code from your branch
-   Then this: `==========`
-   And then the code that it conflicts with from the branch you are trying to merge into
-   This is followed by `>>>>>>>>>>>>> branch-you're-trying-to-merge-into`

  

In order to resolve the conflict, you simply need to delete all the lines that you do not want.

Since Partner A was impatient, **Partner A delete your lines that are conflicting and keep partner B's lines.**

  

When you're finished, delete the `<<<<<<<`, `=========`, and `>>>>>>>>>` lines. This will tell github you have finished the merge.

  

Now, **click the "resolve" button followed by the "commit merge" button.**You'll now be redirected back to your pull request, where **partner B can now go approve the changes, and merge your changes into the** **`master branch`**. Huzzah!

  

Remember to delete your branches, go back to your local master branch and `pull` from `origin master`.
