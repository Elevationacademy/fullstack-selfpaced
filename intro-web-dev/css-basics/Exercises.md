    
Time to get in touch with your inner child and get to the drawing board. Given the following, plain, boring, lifeless HTML:
    
      
```html
    <div id="container">
      ﻿<span class="box" id="first"></span>
      ﻿<span class="box" id="second"></span>
      ﻿<div class="prompt">Name:</div>
      ﻿<input type="text" placeholder="Your name">
      ﻿<div class="prompt">Age:</div>
      ﻿<input type="number" placeholder="How old?">
      ﻿<button class="button">Win</button>
    </div>
```
  

Add some CSS to create this masterpiece:

   **Hint:** The following properties should be enough:
    
      
    
   -   background-color
    -   border
    -   display
    -   width
    -   height
    -   box-shadow
    
      
    
   **Hint 2:** Don't forget about **block** vs. **inline** elements.
