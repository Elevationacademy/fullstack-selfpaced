# Personal Portfolio Project

Welcome to your first bootcamp coding project! ðŸ˜¨ðŸ¤©

You are probably both scared and excited which is fine! It means you're alive ;)

In this project we will practice the following:
- HTML Structure
- CSS, CSS and more CSS
- Flexbox (well, it's CSS)
- Responsive design (also CSS...) 
- Git

## Instructions

Implement responsive design that works on mobile and desktop based on the following images

<a href="/intro-web-dev/project-personal-portfolio/img/portfolio-mobile.png" target="_blank">Mobile Version</a>



### Guidelines
- Use only vanilla HTML and CSS (no frameworks or libraries)
- Use Flexbox for all major layout components
- Make many git commits with meangful names. Looking at your commits on git will explain your progress
- When hovering the "Get in Touch" button it slightly changes the color

![hover button](./img/button-hover.gif ':size=150')
- When hovering the social media buttons they resize

![resize social media](./img/social-media-hover.gif ':size=150')

### Design Guidelines
- Use system fonts: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif
- Heading sizes: h1 (2.5rem), h2 (2rem), h3 (1.5rem)
- Body text: 1rem line-height 1.6
- Section padding: 4rem 0
- Container max-width: 1200px
- Element margins: Use consistent spacing (1rem, 2rem, 3rem)

### Evaluation Criteria
- HTML Structure
- CSS Implementation
- Working with Git
- Design accuracy

## Bonus
Implement everything again but this time using  [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and zero css of our own!
