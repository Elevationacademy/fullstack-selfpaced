# Time Complexity II


Say we have the following array, _sorted_ in increasing order:

```js
let numbers = [24,33,66,102,108,140,146,177,182,217,341,357,372,390,418,427,442,444,469,480,572,624,627,665,680,694,743,768,790,794,852,896,919,942,982,991,1026,1055,1086,1137,1141,1157,1167,1271,1272,1273,1301,1337,1340,1344,1388,1455,1465,1466,1509,1555,1640,1667,1667,1689,1824,1897,1928,1950,1987,2056,2059,2070,2123,2140,2198,2215,2260,2304,2383,2403,2433,2454,2472,2480,2481,2535,2543,2554,2557,2580,2630,2634,2671,2745,2792,2839,2849,2871,2873,2893,2932,2962,2984,2987]
```
  

We know that the number `2630` exists in the array (we are given this information), but we need to find out in what index that number is.

  

We could, naively, write the following code:

```js
const findIndex = function (desiredNumber) {
    for (let i in numbers) {
        if (numbers[i] === desiredNumber) {
            return i
        }
    }
}

console.log("The index is " + findIndex(2630))
```
