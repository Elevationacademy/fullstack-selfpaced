# Prototype & Static Methods

## Quick Note about Prototype

  

Prototype is Javascript's old way of implementing OOP.

ES6 wrapped the prototype syntax so well that we cannot see any hint of it now. We'll go over these a bit more in our inheritance lesson, but if you like, you can read more about prototypes [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype) or [here](http://prototypejs.org/) and [here](http://prototypejs.org/learn/class-inheritance), but don't let the old syntax confuse you.

If you want to know even more about prototypes, you can read about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto).


## Static Methods


  

Now say we want to know general information about the `Vehicle` class we created before.

For instance, let's say that every instance of a class in my code represents a car that was created physically in the real world.

  

We could, each time a vehicle is instantiated, add a count to some external variable - but this is data that is specifically related to `Vehicle` - the count of `Vehicles` should be a part of this class, but _not_ of each instance.

The solution is something called `static`

  

----------

We can create methods and attributes that are **static** - that means available at the class-level, as opposed to the instance-level.

  

So far, any method/attribute we've had belonged to each specific instance of our class.

With **static**, we can change that:

```js
class Vehicle{
    constructor (x, y, speed) {
      this.x = x;
      this.y = y;
      this.speed = speed;
   }

   static getInfo(){
      console.log("Cars are great");
   }
}
```
  

Notice the `static` keyword before our `getInfo` method. To invoke it, we would do this:

  

```js
Vehicle.getInfo()
```
  

This is _different_ from instantiating a class and calling its method (you could not do `car.getInfo( )` if you had a car instance). This method belongs to the _class_, not a particular instance.

  

  

To make this static method useful, let's change our constructor to look like this:

  
```js
constructor(x, y, speed) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.speed = speed;
    Vehicle.carsSold++;
}
```

Now whenever we instantiate a specific car object, we will be incrementing the value of `carsSold` by one.

In other words, we are changing a class-level property each time the constructor is called; i.e each time a new Vehicle is created.

  

But what is the initial value of `carsSold`? We have to define that **after the class definition**, like this:


```js
Vehicle.carsSold = 0;
```
  

That is one way we can create static properties for a class.

Finally, we can make `getInfo` a useful method by changing it to this:

```js
static getInfo() {
    console.log("We've sold " + Vehicle.carsSold + " vehicles.");
}
```
Now go ahead and create two instances of a car, then invoke the `getInfo` method - what do you see logged?

"We've sold 2 vehicles."
