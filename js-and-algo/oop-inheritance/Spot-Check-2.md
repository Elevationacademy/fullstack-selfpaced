# Spot Check 2

What will the following return? Think about these before you test them out in code.

```js
const s1 = new Student("Ronda", 2017)
const t1 = new Teacher("Cassandra", 2002, 40000)
const p1 = new Person("Anon", 1999)

s1 instanceof Person
t1 instanceof Teacher
t1 instanceof Person
s1 instanceof Teacher
t1 instanceof Student
p1 instanceof Person
p1 instanceof Student
p1 instanceof Teacher

s1 instanceof p1
```

Once you complete the above, you might wonder "so is `t1` a `Teacher` or a `Person`?"

  

The answer is both! This is a concept called **polymorphism** - this allows one object to be many types, as we have now.

Indeed, `t1` **IS A** `Teacher`, _and_ `t1` **IS A** `Person` - they are both true.
