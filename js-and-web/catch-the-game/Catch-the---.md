# Catch The...

The premise of the game is that there are some things on the screen - say frogs - and each time the user clicks one, it disappears. Simple enough.

  

But, when all the frogs disappear, the game goes to the next level - there should be _more_ frogs on the screen now.

  

To make it challenging, there's a timer! The user should only have a set amount of time for each level. You can use [setTimeout](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp) for that.

  

So without further ado, here are the instructions:

  

-   Start by creating a few simple `div`s on the screen
	-   Make sure you're generating these dynamically
-   Add a listener to the `div`s that removes them on click
	-   Can you think of a way to do this with MVC?
-   Start a timer
	-   If there are still boxes on the screen when the timer ends*, `alert` the user they lost
	-   Otherwise, add more `div`s to the screen
	-   There should be as many boxes as the level number (Level 1: 1 box, Level 2: 2 boxes, etc)
	-   Each level should add one more second to the timer

###### *Your logic does not have to flow like this. You could check the frog count after each click, or when the timer ends, or every second - you decide on your logic.

This is the most basic version of the game. Once you're done with the basics, and only once you're done, here are features you should add to the game:

  

-   Use [font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) to show an icon instead of a `div`
-   Position each icon randomly instead of one after the other
-   Give each icon a random color
-   Start the game with a button instead of automatically
-   Show a countdown on the top of the screen
	-   Use [setInterval](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp) for that
-   Show the current level
-   Show an updated count of frogs left
-   Instead of alerting a loss, show a message in the middle of the screen
-   Flash the timer yellow each time a new level is reached
-   Flash the timer red when there are 3 or fewer seconds left
-   Change the text on the start button once the game begins
-   Change the size of the frogs depending on how high up they are
	-   Frogs closer to the top of the screen should be smaller
	-   This gives the illusion of depth

  

Note that these are _not_ extensions. These are features you should be able to implement. Just take your time.
