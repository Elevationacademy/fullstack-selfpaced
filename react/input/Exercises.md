# Exercise

create a new react project and solve the following:

## Exercise 1

Create a component called `Exercise1`, and give it the following code.

```js
import { useState } from "react";

const Exercise1 = () => {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({ name: "", age: "" });

  const handleChange = (event, property) => {
    setPerson({ ...person, [property]: event.target.value });
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <input
        id="name-input"
        onChange={(e) => handleChange(e, "name")}
        value={person.name}
      />
      <input
        id="age-input"
        onChange={(e) => handleChange(e, "age")}
        value={person.age}
      />
      <button>Go to Bar</button>
    </div>
  );
};
export default Exercise1;
```

Your goal is to alert a message when the user presses the `button`.

The message should include text from both `input`s. For example, if the user types "Haliax" and 40, your alert could say "Come in Haliax, you're 40 - that's good enough".

Make sure that in the `button`'s method you're accessing the `name` and `age` through `state`, and that generally you're working with inputs the proper React way.

## Exercise 2

Create a component called `Exercise2`, and give it the following code.

```js
import { useState } from "react";

const Exercise2 = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [fruit, setFruit] = useState("");

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        id="name-input"
        onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
        value={name}
      />
      <select
        id="select-input"
        onChange={(e) => setFruit(e.target.value)}
        value={fruit}
      ></select>
    </div>
  );
};
export default Exercise2;
```

Start by checking out the docs about dropdown lists [(select element)](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp).

Next, add a couple of `option`s to the above dropdown, and complete the following:

When the user selects an item from the dropdown, it should update the `fruit` property in state.

After the update (don't forget that `useState` set method is asynchronous), you should console log "`<name>` selected `<fruit>`" - make sure you're accessing `name` from `state`!
