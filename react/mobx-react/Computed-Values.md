# Computed Values

One of MobX's best features is the `computed` decorator. Any value that is marked as `computed` (in `makeObservable`) is a value that can be **automatically derived from the application state.**



For example, if I have an `observable` array of items in a shopping list, I can have a `computed` value that tells me how many items are in my list.



MobX defines them pretty nicely:


> "Computed values can't be underestimated, as they help you to make your actual modifiable state as small as possible. Besides that they are highly optimized, so use them wherever possible."
--MobX docs


MobX only recalculates a `computed` value when an observable is modified. This is what MobX means when they say they are "highly optimized". Using `computed` values will help your app become as efficient as possible.



Let's look at an example. **In your code, go to `src/stores/RestaurantStore.js`**



In the file, you'll see we imported `{ observable, computed, action, makeObservable } from 'mobx'` and two classes - let's look at the `RestaurantStore` class. There's already quite a bit of code in it, but lets look at the following `computed` value in it:

```js
constructor() {
    ...
    makeObservable(this, {
        ...
        totalReservations: computed,
        ...
    }
}

get totalReservations() {
    return this.reservations.length
} 
```

In the `constructor`, we mark one of our `computed` values, `totalReservations` in `makeObservable`! `totalReservations` works like a function that returns the total number of reservations made.



You'll notice we use the `get` keyword when creating the function. This is a getter. We won't go into too much detail on it here, but the important thing to remember about getter is that, through a getter, we can only access a value, we cannot set a value.



This makes sense for a `computed` value, since the value should always be derived from the application state, and never directly changed by `actions`.



So remember, **you always have to use a `get` when you create a `computed` value.**



*Note: getters are functions built in on a class, like a constructor. **Therefore, you should not use an arrow function with a getter!**



We filled in another `computed` value `openTables`. **Take a look at it and make sure you understand how it was made.** You may need to reference the `Reservation` class in `ReservationStore.js` to understand it.
