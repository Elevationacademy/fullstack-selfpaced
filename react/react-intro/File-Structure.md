# File Structure


Open up the project using code lesson or using whichever editor you use, and let's take a look around:

  
![](./vite-file-structure.png ':size=50%')



  

We already know `node_modules`, `index.html`, `.gitignore`, `package.json` and `README.md`.

  

So really all that's new is the **src** folder and its contents. Of those, we're really only interested (for now) in `App.jsx` and `main.jsx`.

  

Before we delve into the actual code, **let's run** `npm run dev` and see what we have - make sure you're in the project's directory.

After running this command you should see the following message from vite acknowledging that the server is up and running with the url:

![](./vite-running.png ':size=25%')


Ok, let's look at some files.

## main.jsx

Let's start with the `main.jsx` file. First, a couple of things:

-   It is a normal JavaScript file
-   You will likely never change it
  
Except for the `import`s at the top of the file, you should only see this code for now:


```js
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>,
)
```
  

Breaking this down:

  

-   `createRoot` is a function imported from React DOM.

First we create a `root`
```js
createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
```

This will be the container for our React App. All the other components and html element will be placed inside of it.

Next we render the React App:
```js
root.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>
);
```

-   `<StrictMode>` - this  is a feature aimed to help us in finding potential problems in an application.
-   `<App />` - this is _what_ we're going to render.
-   Though it looks remarkably similar, **it's not HTML**. It is [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) (a syntax extension to JS which will eventually be used to render HTML) and we'll talk about it properly soon
-   Specifically, it is representing a **component** which we'll also learn about soon
-   `document.getElementById('root')` - this is _where_ we're going to render `<App />`
-   This is plain old vanilla JS. Literally telling it to find something on the DOM with an id of 'root'

  
The root we're adding to `<App />` is in your `index.html` file - a file you will, again, not really want to touch.

  

Inside the file, between all the comments, you should see a simple div. This is where everything in our app will render, eventually:

  

```html
<div id="root"></div>
```
  

To drive the point home, change the `ReacDOM.render`... (in `main.jsx`) line from above to this:

  

```js
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <h1 style={{color:'gold'}}>Hai.</h1>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
  

Now save and go back to your browser and look at that - a golden "Hai."

  

Of course, we're not going to be writing our JSX inside of this render function, but now you see exactly what `root.render(...)` does:

  

1.  Take some JSX
2.  Put it in the element with ID `root`

###### *Behind the scenes, React takes this JSX and uses it to generate HTML. We'll go into that soon.

  

**p.s:** again, JSX is not HTML - it is closer to JS.

Thus, if we wanted to add a `class` attribute to the `h1` above, we would have to use `className` (camelCase) instead, like this:

  

```js
root.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <h1 className={'goldClass'}>Hai</h1>
  </StrictMode>
);
```
  

This will be true for event handlers as well ( `onClick` instead of `onclick` ), but no need to worry about that right now.

  

**Important:** **reset back to the** **`<App />`** **from before**, and let's check out our next file.

### App.jsx

This is where the React fun begins.

  

Following a few imports, we see a **function** called `App`

```js
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <a href="https://vite.dev" target="_blank">
          <img src={viteLogo} className="logo" alt="Vite logo" />
        </a>
        <a href="https://react.dev" target="_blank">
          <img src={reactLogo} className="logo react" alt="React logo" />
        </a>
      </div>
      <h1>Vite + React</h1>
      <div className="card">
        <button onClick={() => setCount((count) => count + 1)}>
          count is {count}
        </button>
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.jsx</code> and save to test HMR
        </p>
      </div>
      <p className="read-the-docs">
        Click on the Vite and React logos to learn more
      </p>
    </>
  )
}
```
This syntax of react is called **Functional Components** There are also **Class Components**, that have the syntax of a class, you might see some classes code here and there, but we will focus on functional components, that are the recommended practice by React.


We can see that `App` is a plain JS function that is exported at the end:

```js
export default App;
```

`App` is an arbitrary name, but good practice.
This is one example of why we often say that React is very close to its JS roots - it uses plain JS, no magic here.

  

We'll talk about components soon enough, but let's see what we do inside of a component:

  

```js
function App() {
  return (/*some JSX*/)
}
```
  

The only thing the function is doing is returning some JSX. 


You can do whatever you want inside of `function` - it's a normal method after all, **but it must return only JSX!**

  

**Note:** you can return as much JSX as you want _but_ it must all be encompassed within one tag (a `div`, `li`, any)

**Another note:** generally, we wrap our returned JSX in parentheses to avoid issues with [automatic semicolon insertion](http://www.bradoncode.com/blog/2015/08/26/javascript-semi-colon-insertion/).

  

Try it yourself. Change some stuff in there. Remove the logo. Play with the text. Add some inline-css (using the style property as with the `root.render(...)` example above) - you should see all the changes appear on the page each time your save your file!

  

You will notice that once you save your file, the browser will update _automatically_  in a new way called HMR (hot module reload) - allows the update of components without requiring a full page reload.  - a nice feature we get with our `vite` setup.


Ok, let's get to some actual code now.
