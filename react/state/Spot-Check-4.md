# Spot Check 4

Create the following two functional components:

-   `Hot`
    -   A Component that contains the a div that has the following text `"I'm feeling too hot! "`
-   `Cold`
    -   A Component that contains the a div that has the following text `"It's too cold in here!"`

  

Create a button which toggles between the two components (switches between them).
  


At first, you should see `Hot`. Then, when you press the button, you should see `Cold`. If you press it again, you should see `Hot` again - go back and forth on each button press.
